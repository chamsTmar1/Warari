# Warari : User friendly wedding planner

- The project has two parts, both reached from the landing page's login/ signup :
  -- The admin part (managing users, notebooks, musicians, pastry shops, hairdressers etc)
  -- The notebook part (where bride and groom can customize their wedding experience)

- This repo contains the Front-end of the application developed in HTML5, CSS3, JS with some database files.
  -- No Back-end configuration, planning to use some CMS like WordPress for that.
  -- Notebooks' part is still under design/development.
